rake_ber_sim_python
===================
After testing, this project can run in python3.
BER simulation of a Rake receiver using 16-QAM and a multipath channel with Rayleigh fading. The simulation is written in Python and relies on NumPy and SciPy. Run **sim.py** to start the simulation. Maybe adjust the simulation parameters beforehand, otherwise it might take some time. **theory.py** contains some functions which return the theoretical bit error ratio, each with a different degree of accuracy.
